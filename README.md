## Unity Learn:  Junior Programmer Course

The goal of this lab is to complete a personal project using the basics, <small>and the new input system ðŸ¤«</small>, that are taught in the [Unity Learn Junior Programmer Course](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer).  Each week, starting with Thursday March 4<sup>th</sup>, 2021, I will attempt to hit the milestone listed.  A date of completion will be listed for each subtask as well as for each milestone.  A postmortem will be written after the completion of the course.

## Project Design Document

Project Began:  Mar. 4, 2021

### Project Concept

1 â€” Player Controls
: You control a Dog Knight in this 3D person dungeon crawler, where WASD & the mouse make the player move, look around, block, and attack.

2 â€” Basic Gameplay
: During the game, monsters appear from set spawn points when the level loads, and the goal of the game is to slay all of the monsters and rescue the dog knight's pet dragon Druug.

3 â€” Sound & Effects
: There will be sound effects when an actor attacks, block an attack, is damaged, or dies.  There will be particle effects when an enemy dies.

4 â€” Gameplay Mechanics
: As the game progresses, each room must be cleared of enemies so that the door to the next room will open.  There will also be a single physics puzzle to activate a switch to open a door.

5 â€” User Interface
: The enemy counter in the top right corner of the screen will decrease whenever an enemy is killed.  The health bars, located above each actor's head, will decrease when they are hit by an attack.  At the start fo the game, the title ***Doge Knight*** will appear, and the game will end either when Druug is rescued or the player dies.

6 â€” Other Features
: A restart option appears when the game ends.  The menu offers a choice difficulty that controls the heath and damage of the player and enemies.
